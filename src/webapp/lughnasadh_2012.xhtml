        <h3>Lughnasadh 2012 - 4th August</h3>


        <img class="inline-image" src="images/lughnasadh.png"/>

        <p/>Lughnasadh is a traditional mid-summer harvest festival. In 2012 the event will return to Aniestoun Meadow where it was held in 2009 and 2010. This event is aimed at the Beltane community of Edinburgh, plus friends and any like minded people who want to get involved.
        <p/>Our ancestors celebrated their good fortune in the harvest at Lughnasadh and it is a common tradition for hand-fastings to take place at this time. In Irish mythology, Lugh, who symbolises the harvest, is brought to find a wife. None can be found and one is fashioned for him out of flowers. His flower bride is lured away by another and Lugh is killed in the ensuing battle. The killing of Lugh symbolises both the harvest, and the end of summer.

        <h3 class="no-section-tag">The Lughnasadh Ritual</h3>

        <p/>Bring something you want to celebrate.

        <p/>To give you some ideas: It could be an object, and object that in some way signifies something you are happy about, you could write something on paper or make a card or you could find natural objects and bless them with the sense of what you are honouring.

        <p/>We will collect these things together in a shrine, which will form part of the ritual. The idea is that while our ancestors celebrated the harvest, with offerings of produce, we modern types have a more tenuous link to the land (most of us anyway). We buy produce all out of season in supermarkets and so on. To make the harvest celebration relevant to us, bring something from your own life to celebrate.

        <p/>There will be a ritual, at the end of which a wicker man will be set alight. This will be a more introspective occasion than Beltane or Samhuin, we don't have an audience to impress for one thing; contemplating your good fortune in what you are celebrating is one theme of this ritual. There are other aspects, some planned, some to figure out on the day, and some that are still rumours...

        <h3 class="no-section-tag">Please Donate for the Feast</h3>

        <p/>As in previous Lughnasadh events there will be a grand feast! Supplies need to be purchased in advance of the event to make this happen, and that money will come entirely from private sources. We would like all who come to make a donation of a suggested amount, in order to recover the costs of the event.  Please note that this is <u>not</u> a ticketed event, and the invitation extends to the entire Beltane Fire Society, past and present. The target amount to raise is £500, and you can see below how close we are to that target.

        <p/>The feast will have a meat option at a suggested donation of £7.50 and a vegan/vegetarian option of £5.50. We hope that you will agree that this is a fair price for a hot meal on a wild camping site, prepared with loving generosity by the amazing kitchen maestro Tom (plus helpers).
