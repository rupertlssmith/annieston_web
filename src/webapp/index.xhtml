        <h3>Willow Cutting at Carmunnock</h3>
        <p>We'll be going to the willow plantation at Carmunnock to cut some willow to plant at Annieston. Mainly along the river bank to help slow the erosion and build up a quick growing area of trees to act as a screen from neighbouring properties and for its wildlife value.</p>

        <h3>Lughnasadh</h3>
        <img class="inline-image" src="images/lughnasadh.png"/>
        <p>Lughnasadh is a traditional harvest festival. In 2012 the event will return to Aniestoun Meadow where it was held in 2009 and 2010.</p>
        <p>Our ancestors celebrated their good fortune in the harvest at Lughnasadh and it is a common tradition for hand-fastings to take place at this time. In Irish mythology, Lugh, who symbolises the harvest, is brought to find a wife. None can be found and one is fashioned for him out of flowers. His flower bride is lured away by another and Lugh is killed in the ensuing battle. The killing of Lugh symbolises both the harvest, and the end of summer.</p>

        <h3>Fencing and Tree Planting</h3>
        <p>The Edinburgh University Dirty Weekenders, helped to plant a small area of trees and to build a fence. Turned out to be an amazing day, above 20C, and afterwards we went swimming in the river. Thanks for all the help, got all the work done quickly and I was impressed by your commitment to get the fence finished.</p>
