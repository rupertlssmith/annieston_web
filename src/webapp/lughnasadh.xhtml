        <p>Lughnasadh is a traditional harvest festival. Our ancestors celebrated their good fortune in the harvest at Lughnasadh and it is a common tradition for hand-fastings, and other oaths and contracts to be taken at this time. In Irish mythology, Lugh, who symbolises the harvest, is brought to find a wife. None can be found and one is fashioned for him out of flowers. His flower bride is lured away by another and Lugh is killed in the ensuing battle. The killing of Lugh symbolises both the harvest, and the end of summer.</p>
        
        <h3 class="no-section-tag">Games, Skills, Feast and Ritual</h3>

        <p>Lughnasadh is a celebration of the peak of the growing season, a chilled out community event, and a moment for reflection as summer begins to fade. Games of skill, some skill sharing workshops, a feast and a ritual are the central components of the event.</p>

        <h3 class="no-section-tag">Please Donate for the Feast (and other supplies)</h3>

        <p>A note about donations for meat eaters. This donation has been split into 2 parts, one towards the overall cost of the event for everyone, and a separate item towards the cost of the lamb. Slightly confusing, but it has been done this way to ensure that monies towards the lamb are dealt with completely separately in order to appease the consciences of non-meat eaters.</p>

        <p>The Lughnasadh feast is a central part of the event; there is no more appropriate way to celebreate the bounty of nature than to enjoy it in good company. Supplies need to be purchased in advance of the event to make this happen. We would like all who come to make a donation of a suggested amount, in order to share the costs of the doing this. Please note that this is <u>not</u> a ticketed event.</p>

        <p>We are hoping to raise up to &#163;1000 through your generosity, and you can see above how close we are to that target. The feast is the one of main cost associated with Lughnasadh, but a some of the funds raised will go towards fire projects and games and some other items. In particular this year, Stuart is trying to raise some money towards making a better communal tent, that will last for longer than previous improvised ones.</p>

        <p>Thank you for you donation, we respect your contribution and a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SRhV8hBHKXIznMkjdoMAiS_-FwX_EWDgraTBwX8MAC0/edit?usp=sharing">full breakdown of how funds are being spent</a> is available, thanks to the dedicated efforts of Stuart Barrett.</p>
